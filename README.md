# Gravity 0.0

It is an educational game built in the Godot Engine using GDScript. 
In the game, players experience what it feels like to float in microgravity inside the ISS. 
They solve puzzles, complete tasks, and advance through levels, simulating real astronaut challenges. 
Along the way, they continue to explore Cupola views and gain knowledge through an engaging, hands-on experience.

This project goes beyond traditional textbook learning by providing an immersive and interactive experience. 
Users not only gain scientific knowledge about the ISS and Earth observation but also feel the astronaut experience.
